# Pyano: DevRel Agents Framework

A composable, resource-efficient framework for building DevRel AI agents, built with Rust.

## üöÄ What is Pyano?
Pyano is building the future of developer relations through two groundbreaking initiatives:

### DevRel Agent Orchestration Layer: A platform where anyone can deploy AI agents to automate developer relationship tasks:

- Automated GitHub issue triage and PR reviews
- Intelligent responses to developer queries across Discord and Telegram
- Proactive update notifications and documentation management
- Technical content generation and maintenance
- Developer feedback collection and analysis
- Open source contibution rewards


### Edge AI Framework: Run your DevRel agents locally with our cutting-edge framework:

Deploy agents on your own infrastructure
Keep proprietary codebases and sensitive data private
Reduce operational costs significantly
Maintain complete control over your AI models
Process data locally without cloud dependencies



## üí° Why Pyano?

### Privacy First

- Your code, conversations, and developer data never leave your infrastructure
- Complete control over sensitive information
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### Cost-Effective

- Eliminate expensive cloud AI service subscriptions
- Utilize existing hardware resources
- Scale efficiently with your needs

### Developer-Centric

- Open-source foundation
- Extensible architecture
- Custom agent development support
- Integration with existing developer tools

### üõ† Features

- Local Model Finetuning : Train agents on your codebase while maintaining privacy
- Multi-Platform Support: Deploy across GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and more
- Customizable Workflows: Tailor agent behavior to your DevRel needs
- Analytics Dashboard: Track engagement and agent performance
- API Integration: Connect with your existing development tools
- Resource Optimization: Efficient resource usage on local hardware

## üîÆ Future Vision
We believe every organization should have their own DevRel agents running locally, processing proprietary codebases securely while maintaining privacy. Pyano makes this possible through our Edge AI framework, democratizing access to advanced DevRel automation.
